## Business Context

### Status

- Significant marketing spend
- Attribution driven
- Lack of visibility on offline spending

### Objective

- Incrementally improve the marketing measurement:
    - Geo-Experimentation
    - Media Mix Models (MMM)

## Geo-Experimentation

## Media Mix Model (MMM)

- Decided for an in-house (custom) implementation of a MMM:
    - Facebook Robyn is very unstable
    - Google's Lightweight MMM was under beta development
    - I had experience with MMMs and PyMC.
    - Implementation of ["Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modeling with Carryover and Shape Effects", by Jin et al. (2017)](https://research.google/pubs/bayesian-methods-for-media-mix-modeling-with-carryover-and-shape-effects/).
    - Production-Level Code (modular, tests, diagnostics, etc.)
    - The data ... ðŸ« 

## Desision Making {.smaller}

### How to bring the mmm for decision making?

- **Strategy 1:** Simulations and par
- **Strategy 2:** Education and training
- **Strategy 3:** Productionization (automation)
- **Strategy 4:** Experiments ðŸ‘ˆ
